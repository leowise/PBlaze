Sept. 24. 2012 - Debugging: wrong sub-routine line number (line number is off by one): Found that i am increasing the 
				 key by one in the GetCodeItems sub.
				 Fix: Change the key + 1 statement to key.
				 Result: Works, line numbers match text.

				Debugging: selection on sub-routine list, file content scrolls to selected sub.
				Fix: Added code to the dataGridView1_SelectionChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) method

				Mod: Reduce the amount of text shown in the sub-routine view.
				Fix: Added code to: strSubrutineItems.Add(lineNumber, subrName[0].Substring(0, m1.Index + 1));
				in method GetCodeItems method to chop the string as needed.

				Debugging: Found issue when opening a different source file, app crashed with collection index out of bounds,
				Fix: Added code to test if the source was changing or had changed, then condition the update to the UI based on 
				a flag. 
				Result. Works, code is not optimal!!!

				Code Cleanup: Removed obsolete methods, cleaned code. More needs to be done.

				Sept. 25, 2012 - 
				Debugging: When opening a file which had been edited and saved, got "Unsafe cross-thread call error" started to 
				code to use the background worker method to make safe calls, but the issue seems to have gone away after the above 
				fix! Will comeback if issue resurfaces, or just to test methodology.

				Dec. 04, 2012 - Corrected issue with display re-sizing.

				Dec. 6, 2012 - Issue: When source file changes, the app opens two dialogs and user has to click twice, will
